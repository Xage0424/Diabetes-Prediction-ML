# Simple Machine Learning Diabetes Prediction

# Algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Classifier
3. KNearest Neighbors Classifier
4. Random Forest Classifier

# Python Libraries used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-learn

# Conclusion (Comment at the end):
It seems that the svc model has reached its maximum potential on a imbalanced dataset. I think the solution is to have more data and also to solve the imbalanced dataset. 
After that, select a few more classification models based on the problem, data, and the expected outcome
