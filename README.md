# Simple Machine Learning Diabetes Prediction

# Algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Classifier
3. KNearest Neighbors Classifier
4. Random Forest Classifier

# Python Libraries used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-learn

# EDA Analysis and Visualization summary:
- There are no missing values in the dataset
- The dataset is imbalanced
- No negative and closer to 1.0 correlations based on the correlation matrix
- The features are skewed and have outleirs

# Conclusion (Comment at the end):
It seems that the svc model has reached its maximum potential on a imbalanced dataset. I think the solution is to have more data and also to solve the imbalanced dataset. 
After that, select a few more classification models based on the problem, data, and the expected outcome
- It seems that the SVC model has reached its maximum potential on a imbalanced dataset
- Other solutions is to penalize or apply regularization and gradient descent techniques in the selected models
- Other solutions is to have more data to solve the imbalanced dataset or use sampling techniques
- After that, select a few more classification models based on the defined problem, type of data, and the expected outcome
